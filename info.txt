🏷️ What is Stateless?

Stateless means the server does not store any information about the client’s state (session) between requests.

Each request must contain all the necessary information for the server to understand and process it.

Example: JWT-based authentication → the client sends the token with every request, and the server just verifies it without storing anything about the session.

🏷️ What is Stateful?

Stateful means the server remembers information (state) about the client between requests.

The server maintains a session (in memory or database) after login, and each request references that stored session.

Example: Traditional session-based login → the server keeps a session object, and the client only sends a session ID (cookie).
